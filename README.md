# nba_shot
Using regression analysis to construct a linear weights analytic describing different shots in the NBA, and use that to construct visualizations. Each shot has different time measures, an identity variable, the number of points and the coordinates of a shot, with the centre at the left corner of the court. 

Contents:
- **The Logit Model**: a measure of expected makes by predicting a shot being made as a function of different characteristics of the shot.
- **Heat Maps**: measure for expected points contingent on whether a shot was a 2 or 3-pointer; visualizations - expected points/no. of points by location.
- **Shot Charts**: creating a variable to account for an above-average shot; visualisation of Kobe Bryant's shots by location, one for raw value per shot and a second for the above-average analytic. 
- **Fixed Effects Regressions**: focusing on players with over 800 shots; re-run model with fixed effects for each player.
- **Correlations**:
